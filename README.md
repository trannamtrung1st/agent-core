# Agent Core MVP

Agent Core is a lightweight runtime for creating persistent AI identities capable of natural, real-time conversation.

An agent can represent a customer service representative, examiner, tutor, friend, interviewer, receptionist, or another role. The goal of the MVP is not to build a general-purpose autonomous-agent platform. The goal is to prove that one reusable Agent Core can inhabit different identities and interact naturally through text and voice.

The distinctive idea is the combination of:

- persistent agent identity and behavioral policy;
- continuously running conversational state;
- a separate Interaction Controller that observes the live environment;
- interruption and turn-taking support;
- proactive interaction initiated by the agent when appropriate;
- provider-agnostic backend interfaces;
- a simple personal-chat-style web UI with a voice-call mode.

## MVP thesis

> Make an AI agent feel present in a live conversation.

The most important qualities are:

1. low latency;
2. natural turn-taking;
3. interruption / barge-in;
4. identity consistency;
5. restrained proactive behavior;
6. conversation continuity.

Complex tool orchestration, multi-agent systems, workflow builders, marketplaces, and advanced long-term memory are intentionally outside the first MVP.

## Suggested implementation direction

The implementation should use narrow, composable interfaces and adapters rather than coupling the core runtime to any specific model vendor.

The first production adapter can target an OpenAI-compatible API. The same interfaces should also support:

- fake or deterministic test providers;
- synthetic scripted providers;
- local models;
- alternative hosted LLM providers;
- alternative speech-to-text providers;
- alternative text-to-speech providers;
- a native realtime model provider in the future.

The core runtime should depend on interfaces such as `LanguageModel`, `SpeechRecognizer`, `SpeechSynthesizer`, `RealtimeTransport`, `MemoryStore`, and `Clock`, not on concrete SDKs.
